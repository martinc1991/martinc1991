### Summary

Hi, my name is Martin. I'm a full-stack developer from Argentina, and I've been coding since 2019. I mostly work on web-related projects 🌐, but I also have experience with mobile 📱 and desktop app development 💻, and also blockchain dApps.

### Experience

Here are some notable projects that I've worked on:

- A **Fullstack Web Application** which you can use as a team builder for generation III competitive pokemon battles in [PokemonShowdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/). It's built using a monorepo architecture with NextJs and Tailwind for the frontend, and NestJs, Prisma and PostgreSQL for the backend. Unit-tested and dockerized for ease of use. Check the [code here](https://github.com/martinc1991/pokemon-gen3-teambuilder).

- A **React-Native mobile app** for Club Atletico Belgrano, a prominent soccer team in Argentina ⚽. You can download it from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sooft.belgrano) or the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ar/app/app-oficial-de-c-a-belgrano/id1577599858).

- A **web platform made with React** that facilitates class management, attendance tracking, homework assignments, and the management of institutional assets such as classrooms, teachers, and subjects. You can learn more about this project [here](https://aula.educabot.com/).

### What am I doing nowadays?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some web2 and web3 projects

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about **blockchain technologies**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open source projects**
