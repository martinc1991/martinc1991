### Hello stranger, welcome to my GitHub profile 🪐

Hi, my name is **Martin**. I'm a full-stack web developer from Argentina, and I've been coding since 2019. I mostly work on web-related projects 🌐, but I also have experience with mobile 📱 and desktop app development 💻.

I maintain a blog where **I write about topics such as React, TypeScript, and other web-related stuff**. Feel free to check it out at [this link](https://bit90s-blog.vercel.app/).

Here are some notable projects that I've worked on:

- A **Fullstack Web Application** which you can use as a team builder for generation III competitive pokemon battles in [PokemonShowdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/). It's built using a monorepo architecture with NextJs and Tailwind for the frontend, and NestJs, Prisma and PostgreSQL for the backend. Unit-tested and dockerized for ease of use. Check the [code here](https://github.com/martinc1991/pokemon-gen3-teambuilder).
 
- A **React-Native mobile app** for Club Atletico Belgrano, a prominent soccer team in Argentina ⚽.  You can download it from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sooft.belgrano) or the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ar/app/app-oficial-de-c-a-belgrano/id1577599858).

- A **web platform made with React** that facilitates class management, attendance tracking, homework assignments, and the management of institutional assets such as classrooms, teachers, and subjects. You can learn more about this project [here](https://aula.educabot.com/).
